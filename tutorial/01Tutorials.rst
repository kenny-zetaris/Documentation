In here we go through a basic use case covering

     - Loading data to Lightning
     - Loading data to Fusion
     - Creating views
     - Reporitng on those views using Alchemist

Loading and Querying data in Lightning & Fusion
-------------------------------------------------

To load data to lightning run the following scripts ::

    - Open the script file - sample1_dataload.sql

To load data to Fusion run the following scripts :

Use your favorite SQL editor to run them. Refer <link to dbvisualizer>::

     - Run the script file <link>

Once the tables has been created and loaded. Its time to create the views for the reports.

Open the script file - sample1_query.sql

     - Register the Tables.
     - Checking the tables are accessible.
     - Run the report queries.
     - Register the queres as Views.

Creating Reports (Alchemist)
------------------------------

Creating reports from FusionDB

   - Create the connections to FusionDB
   - Pull the tables to the datalayer
   - Prepare the query for the worksheet
   - And build the charts

Creating Reports (Lightning)
